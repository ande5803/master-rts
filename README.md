This repository tracks the development of a Real-Time Strategy game developed as a case study for the final master project
conducted by Anders Bundgaard in Fall 18 - Spring 19. The game is intentionally developed as a primitive imitation of the
LibGDX demo project Pax Britannica (https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-pax-britannica).
